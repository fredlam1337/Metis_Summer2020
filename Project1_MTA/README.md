# **Metis Project 1 - Summer 2020**


## Group Members: 
Frederick Lam, Lisa VanderVoort, Harry Smith, Lindsay Read

## About:

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is an organization that works to increase the participation and awareness of women in the tech industry. They host an annual gala at the beginning of the summer and are planning to place street teams at subways entrances in New York City to collect email addresses. Those who sign up will be sent free tickets to the gala.

They've asked us to help optimize the placement of the street teams by using MTA subway data to increase the number of sign-ups, prioritizing  those who are more keen to attending the gala and supporting their vision.

This project aims to be a resource for WTWY to make some decesions as to where and when to place their street teams.
